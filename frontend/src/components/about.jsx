          <h2>Team</h2>
          <p>
            We are a group of four Software Project students working on this website as a project for an Open Source Project Course. Our team members bring diverse skills and experiences to the table, allowing us to tackle challenges creatively and effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our main goal is to create an open-source website for a library system. This project builds upon the knowledge and skills we acquired in previous courses, where we implemented a library system. By making our website open source, we aim to contribute to the software development community and provide a valuable resource for libraries and their patrons.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are passionate about creating high-quality software that is accessible, user-friendly, and meets the needs of our users. Through collaboration and dedication, we strive to deliver a website that not only fulfills the requirements of our course but also makes a positive impact on the community.
